# OOP

 - A type of computer programming where programmers define the data type and methods of a data structure, which becomes an object

 ### OOP Concepts

- Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing functionality

- Class: A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it

- Constructor:

- Encapsulation: Wrapping code and data together into a single unit

- Polymorphism: A general behavior from a parent class can be overridden in a child class to give it more specifics

- Inheritance: When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object

- Interface: A contract between the class and the outside world

- Composition: Combining objects or functions together

- Concurrency: When two or more "processes" are executing simultaneously over the same period

- Parallelism: Things happening at literally the same time. All parallelism is concurrent, but not all concurrency is parallel

- Isomorphism: If you look at the same entity in two different contexts, you should get the same thing such as a framework that runs both client side and server side. The backend and frontend share same code. Ex: Meteor React

- Dynamic Programming: A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems once, and storing their solutions
